# AI Text Summarization Application with Gradio

This project is a simple text summarization application built using Gradio and Hugging Face's Transformers. The application allows users to input a lengthy text and generates a summarized version based on the specified parameters.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

To start, you'll need to install the required libraries in your Google Colab environment:

```bash
!pip install transformers
!pip install gradio
```

### 2. Import Libraries and Initialize the Model

After installing the dependencies, import the necessary libraries and initialize the summarization model:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import gradio as gr

# Instantiate the pipeline for summarization using the BART model
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
```

### 3. Define the Summarization Function

Create a function to generate the summary from the input text:

```python
def summarize(article):
    return summarizer(article, min_length=30, max_length=200, do_sample=False)[0]["summary_text"]
```

### 4. Create the Gradio Interface

Set up the Gradio interface to interact with the summarization function:

```python
app = gr.Interface(fn=summarize, inputs="text", outputs="text")
app.launch()
```

### 5. Run the Application

Launch the application to start using the text summarization tool:

```python
app.launch()
```

### Example Usage

You can input a long piece of text into the provided text box, and the application will return a summarized version. The summary is generated using the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## Potential UI Improvements

Here are some suggestions to enhance the user interface and experience in future iterations of this application:

1. **Text Area Resizing**:
   - Allow users to resize the text input area to accommodate longer texts more comfortably. This can be done by using Gradio's `textarea` input type with adjustable dimensions.

   ```python
   app = gr.Interface(fn=summarize, inputs=gr.inputs.Textbox(lines=15, placeholder="Enter your text here..."), outputs="text")
   ```

2. **Character Count Indicator**:
   - Add a character count indicator next to the text input to help users stay within the modelâ€™s optimal input length. This can prevent issues related to truncating long texts.

3. **Dropdown for Summary Length**:
   - Provide a dropdown menu for users to select the desired length of the summary (e.g., short, medium, long). This allows for more customizable output.

   ```python
   length = gr.inputs.Dropdown(["short", "medium", "long"], label="Summary Length")
   app = gr.Interface(fn=lambda text, length: summarize(text, length), inputs=["text", length], outputs="text")
   ```

4. **Loading Indicator**:
   - Implement a loading indicator to inform users that their summary is being processed, especially for longer texts.

5. **Text Highlighting**:
   - After generating the summary, highlight key phrases or sentences in the original text to show users what content was deemed important by the model.

6. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Add support for multiple languages by including a dropdown menu for users to select the input text language. The model can then adjust accordingly.

7. **Output Comparison**:
   - Allow users to generate and compare summaries with different parameters (e.g., diverse vs. most likely summary) side by side for better insights.
